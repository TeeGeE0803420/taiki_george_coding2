I started off with a tube SOP, and morphed it using two twist SOPs. I used a SOPto and CHOPto to add a noise and position null. I assigned the position null to the geo CHOP. I created an audio network playing Skepta, and mucked around with the end outcome using mirror TOPS. I am very proud of this work because I dove deeper into my experimentation of SOPS and TOPS. I really enjoyed playing around with the mirror TOPS as it would give me the coolest looking outcomes. I also liked how I could project a song that I like, it made this piece feel more like me. In the future I think colour would make this piece of art pop off.

I started off with 2 circle SOPS and changed the dimensions of each one. I connected these SOPS with a copy of the SOP. I created my Geometry network, and I assigned a line material to it. I used a rgb key TOP to change the background to black. I am proud of this work because I was struggling with geometry networks in class, but after this piece I got the hang of it. I would like to develop my geometry networks in the future by making it audio reactive , as I think that would look and sound really good. I felt like I achieved geometry renders, and I can now, without thinking, create them with any SOPs I want to use.

For this code, I started with a circle TOP and turned the dimensions down to make it a triangle. I connected a transform and feedback TOP, using absTime.seconds I animated the rotation of the triangle. I changed the colours in the circle TOP to green and white. I am proud of this outcome because it was my first creative code that I did entirely by-myself as a touch designer. It took a lot of trial and error to get my desired outcome such as the right rotation speed, but  it worked out in the end. It was also my first time using animations which I found really cool. If I could make improvements to this code in the future I would make improvements with the aesthetics, maybe adding a lookup or bloom TOP.

also this file has 2 pieces of code in it, I am describing the first green circle code.



Frog:
Environment: openprocessing
week: 2 
This was my first project on openprocessing so I feel a certain attachment to it, even though it isn't the greatest picture, or the colours don't quite match up. It is still probably my favourite piece I've made. To make this frog I had to section different parts of the frog out and draw it out using a rectangle function and coordinates to tell the software where to paint the lines. I also used fill and rgb values to color in the rectangles. If I make any future changes it would definitely be finding a matching color palette for the frog so it could look a little bit more pleasing to the eye. I feel like I achieved the first part of p5js with this code, and it kinda opened my mind on all the cool things that there is to come.

German flag:
environment: openprocessing 
week: 2
I'm not too sure why I made a german flag (I am cook island) I guess it was a bit easier to make than a cook island flag, bear in mind this was week 2 and I didnt have all the knowledge I have accumulated today. I sectioned out three parts of the canvas and used the rectangle function plus coordinates to draw the line separating the sections. I again used rgb values and the fill function to colour in the three sections. I felt that during the making of this artwork I had a sense of achievement because I could now confidently use this software to make anything that I wanted to, and I would bring this skill into the future for when I need to make more complex designs.

Chicken:
environment: openprocessing
week: 2 
Making the chicken was the most enjoyable piece of art that i have made, because it looked so cool ( like a minecraft chicken) but also was simple to make. It took me a little longer to make than the others because of the many more sections I had to draw. But when I was done it felt amazing and I truly felt a sense of accomplishment as this was the most aesthetic and complex art I had created in openprocessing. For this chicken I acknowledged that I needed a proper colour pallet (unlike the frog) so I took my time in carefully choosing the right colours for each section, which I think I nailed. For future improvements I think I should experiment more in other functions other than just rect().
