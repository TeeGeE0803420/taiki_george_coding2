I started off with a tube SOP, and morphed it using two twist SOPs, i used a SOPto and CHOPto to add a noise and position null. I assigned the position null to the geo CHOP. I created a audio network playing Skepta, and mucked around with the end outcome using mirror TOPS. I am very proud of this work because i dove deeper into my extermination of SOPS and TOPS, I really enjoyed playing around with the mirror TOPS as it would give me the coolest looking outcomes. I also liked how I could project a song that i like, it made this piece feel more like me. In the future I think colour would make this piece of art pop off.

I started off with 2 circle SOPS and changed the dimensions of each one. I connected these SOPS with a copy SOP. I created my Geometry network, and I assigned a line material to it. I used a rgb key TOP to change the background to black. I am proud of this work because I was struggling with geometry networks in class, but after this piece I got the hang of it. I would like to develop my geometry networks in the future by making it audio reactive , as I think that would look really good.

for this code, I started with a circle TOP and turned the dimensions down to make it a triangle. I connected a transform and feedback TOP, using absTime.seconds I animated the rotation of the triangle. I changed the colours in the circle TOP to green and white. I am proud of this outcome because it was my first creative code that I did entirely by-myself in touch designer. It took alot of trial and error to get my desired outcome such as the right rotation speed, but  it worked out in the end. If i could make improvements to this code in the future I would make improvements with the aesthetics, maybe adding a lookup or bloom TOP.

also this file has 2 peices of code in it, I am describing the first green circle code.
