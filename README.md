I started off with a tube SOP, and morphed it using two twist SOPs, i used a SOPto and CHOPto to add a noise and position null. I assigned the position null to the geo CHOP. I created a audio network playing Skepta, and mucked around with the end outcome using mirror TOPS. I am very proud of this work because i dove deeper into my extermination of SOPS and TOPS, I really enjoyed playing around with the mirror TOPS as it would give me the coolest looking outcomes. I also liked how I could project a song that i like, it made this piece feel more like me. In the future I think colour would make this piece of art pop off.

I started off with 2 circle SOPS and changed the dimensions of each one. I connected these SOPS with a copy SOP. I created my Geometry network, and I assigned a line material to it. I used a rgb key TOP to change the background to black. I am proud of this work because I was struggling with geometry networks in class, but after this piece I got the hang of it. I would like to develop my geometry networks in the future by making it audio reactive , as I think that would look really good.
